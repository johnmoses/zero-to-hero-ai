    "Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning algorithms where an agent learns to make successive decisions by interacting with its surroundings. The agent receives the feedback in the form of incentives or punishments based on its actions. The agent’s purpose is to discover optimal tactics that maximize cumulative rewards over time through trial and error. Reinforcement learning is frequently employed in scenarios in which the agent must learn how to navigate an environment, play games, manage robots, or make judgments in uncertain situations"
